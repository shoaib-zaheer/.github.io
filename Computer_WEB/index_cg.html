                  <!-- I still remember he was short in height, and his head was designed a little bigger than the rest of his body; this is why others were calling him "The big brain," but he was a big brain indeed. The big brain showed something that day, a masterpiece that acted as an interlude, interval, or a note to keep a purpose in my life alive.

                    He worked hard to reach the highest point of the board and start as high or from as top as possible. After climbing a chair, he gained access to the highest point of the black spot painted on the wall. The wall was structured to keep us separate from the old, dirty machinery on the opposite side. I do not know what machinery or factory is, as my mind cannot draw any image for explanation. Maybe it is also because my complete concentration was on that boy, his height, and that black spot. The black spot was painted by emptying all our calligraphy ink bottles. Just a week ago, our teacher asked every student to bring at least one full but small bottle of black ink for calligraphy. However, our old blackboard was destroyed, God knows how! Two days ago, at the request of our teacher, we emptied all our black ink bottles to achieve the dark, black look on the board. <br><br>
                    In addition, I do not remember what room it was, but whenever I ask my mother what place it was, she tells me, "You were in the first class in school." As she could not leave me at home alone, she always took me with her to school and then left me with someone whose face or gender I do not remember. My mother has told me many times that the person was kind enough to let me stay with other students in class. She also mentioned that the school did not allow me to be in that class as I was younger than the other kids and needed to wait two more years before joining. Anyhow, I do not remember more than just that day about that class. <br><br>
                    That boy drew a beautiful elephant from the book. Everyone praised him rigorously. Why not? He drew very precisely, cleanly, and marvelously. I still wish and hope that someday I might be able to draw as well as he did that day. But that day was a turning point for me, and from that day onward, I am just trying to draw my wish.
